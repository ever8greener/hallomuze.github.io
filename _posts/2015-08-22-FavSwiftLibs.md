### My favorite swift libraries that I can't live without
* [Color Extension Swift Library](https://github.com/bennyguitar/Colours) will save your time.
We all use color picker or lookup for Hex Value for UICOLOR. You don't have to do that with this  extension 
* [SwiftyUserDefaults](https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults) will make NSUserDefaults so simple to use.
